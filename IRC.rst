One of the ways of getting in touch with the SuperTux community and developers
is to use IRC. IRC is a form of real-time chat that's been around for ages.
While there might be some people in the channel, they might not always be
available to help you. If no-one answers to your questions, please wait and
don't leave the channel. Also, do not ask to ask a question. Just ask.

Our channel is on the `Libera Chat IRC network <https://libera.chat/>`__. If you
simply want to start, just use the
`webchat <https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat:+6697/?nick=Guest?#supertux>`__.

There are also different desktop clients such as HexChat. If you use one of
them, you will want to connect to `irc.libera.chat` on port 6697 (TLS) and
join the channel `#supertux`.
