Tux the Penguin is the main character and protagonist of SuperTux. Tux's goal in SuperTux is to rescue his
girlfriend Penny from the evil Nolok.

Tux has to chase down Nolok through different worlds with different climates, but will have different
[actions](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Actions) to help him in his rescue attempt.

</details>

Penny the Penguin is the girlfriend of Tux who has been kidnapped by the evil Nolok during a nice picnic with
her beloved Tux.

While all attempts to escape by herself have failed, she manages to provide Tux with helpful information about her
situation through secret letters. But perhaps Nolok has even taken that into account?

Nolok the crocodile is the main enemy of Tux, the antagonist of SuperTux. Nolok is always menacing but with
a hint of "laid back"; he is very confident but not to the point of being egotistical. Like a cat plays with
mice, Nolok is a predator and derives pleasure and entertainment from playing with his prey. So the reason he
kidnaps Penny is that he derives entertainment out of Tux feeling sorrow towards his beloved Penny and having
no idea where to find her. Additionally, Nolok enjoys to see Tux suffer on his journey, thus leading him to
leave jeering notes and wreak havoc on the world by sending out his minions (the badguys and bosses). But
Nolok is also like a crocodile hunting in that he waits patiently for his prey to come to him before he
springs his ambush; that's why we don't see Nolok in person until the very last stage when Nolok is ready to
confront Tux.

Badguys
=======

List of badguys:

- [Icy Island](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Badguys-Icy)
- [Rooted Forest](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Badguys-Forest)
- [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Badguys-Misc)
- [Bosses](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Bosses)

A badguy in SuperTux is a foe of Tux, serving as Nolok's minion. They may not be "bad" in the way that a
snowball isn't really bad, but they can certainly hurt Tux. Most of the badguys are creatures, like Snowballs
with varying characteristics, but some are more like objects (Stalactite for example) or phenomena like Flame.

Tux will try to avoid approaching badguys if possible. If he runs into one or one drops on his head, he is hurt.
When hurt Tux will lose a powerup or, if Tux has no powerups left, he will be killed.

Many of the badguys Tux can knock out by jumping on them and squishing them. Others are only stunned by this
for a short while or are insusceptible to this and hurt Tux instead. As a rule of thumb, badguys with a spiky
head or helmet can usually not be jumped on.

Proposed list of characters
===========================

Fluffy
------

Fluffy is a penguin that never moulted from his original fluffy feathers, so he looks like a baby penguin. He is
a good friend of Tux and Penny. However, he can't run as fast as Tux, but he can jump higher. Fluffy would be a
second character for multiplayer which the person playing the game could control instead of Tux.

Granito
-------

<details>
  <summary>Concept Art</summary>

![](images/Granito.png)
</details>

Granitos are rock-like creatures living in Rooted Forest and are plagued by the Ghost Tree corrupting their land.

They are peaceful in nature and only those infected by the Ghost Tree's turn hostile. In-game, large Granito can be
encountered occasionally, resting in the wild, minding their own business. Tux can jump on them, like a platform, to
reach extra heights or avoid approaching badguys or simply let them be.

Corrupted Granito will attack when Tux is in sight and try to crush him under their own weight. They cannot be defeated
but once they fell on the ground their infected bodies are too weak to rise back up thus remainng immobile.

Gandrus
-------

Gandrus is a big imposing walrus with a beard acting as a shopkeeper for the planned shops.
